## git add

## git log
Git logs allow you to review and read a history of everything that happens to a repository
### A full log has the following pieces:

1. A commit hash (SHA1 40 character checksum of the commits contents). Because it is generated based on the commit contents it is unique.
2. Commit Author metadata: The name and email address of the author of the commit.
3. Commit Date metadata: A date timestamp for the time of the commit
4. Commit title/message: The overview of the commit as written in the commit message.
